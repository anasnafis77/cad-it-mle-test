 The main goal of the paper is to establish a criterion for selecting the ``best'' model complexity  SYMBOL based on regressors  SYMBOL  given as a black box without insight into the origin or inner structure of  SYMBOL , that does not depend on things often not given (like a stochastic noise model),  and that exploits what is given (like the loss function)
